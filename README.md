# MIT No AI License

A an extension of the MIT License that has desired formatting and excludes the use of the licensed software in GitHub Copilot and other such systems.

The MIT License that is extended was copied from [here](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) website. It was copied verbatim and only moderately edited for *formatting only* and the extended AI exclusions. The edits included whitespace edits, adding the "MIT License" term at the top, putting in a markdown comment where to enter the year and copyright holder's or holders' name(s), and ensuring the text was formatted as contiguous paragraphs so that they can be properly displayed. Additionally, an extended condition is to prevent the use of the licensed software in GitHub Copilot or any other AI or ML-based code suggestion system.
